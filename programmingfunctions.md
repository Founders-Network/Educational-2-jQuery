<b>Functions</b>


A function perferoms a specific task.  
Function names follow the same conventions as variables.  
Functions are defined by the `function` keyword followed by the name of the function and `()`  
For example: 
```javascript 
function calculateSum(number1, number2) {
  var sum = number1 + number 2+;
  return sum;
}
```
`number1, number2` are parameters to the function while the values it receives are arguments.  
The `return` statement indicates the end of the function.  
Functions usually compute a value which is returned to the "caller".  
In this case, the sum of the two numbers is returned.
