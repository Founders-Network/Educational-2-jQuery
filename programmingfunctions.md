<b>Functions</b>


A function perferoms a specific task.  
Function names follow the same conventions as variables.  
Functions are defined by the `function` keyword followed by the name of the function and `()`  
For example: 
```javascript 
function calculateSum(number1, number2) {
  var sum = number1 + number 2;
  return sum;
}
var x = calculateSum(3,6);
```
`number1, number2` are called parameters to the function while the values it receives, `3, 6` are called arguments.  
The `return` statement indicates the end of the function.  
Functions usually compute a value which is returned to the "caller".  
In this case, `x` will have a value of 9.
