# Ideas

**Add ideas (curricula, projects, etc.) below in point form:**

Project
* Rock Paper Scissors

Curricula
* We might need to quickly go over and review the CSS material.. if we have time
* variables
* functions
* jQuery's selector class
* jQuery click events
* styling elements with jQuery

Style of Teaching
* Show and run the game for them first 
* We should be coding with them to be more interactive - making them follow the slides would be too dull
* We could use one screen for the code and the other for the HTML page that would be displayed so they could see them side by side
